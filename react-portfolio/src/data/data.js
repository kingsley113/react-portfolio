      "CyberBug is a React application designed to help track and manage software bugs. As my final project with Flatiron School, this was an opportunity to combine everything taught over the program and create a true full stack application. Cyberbug utilizes a ReactJS frontend and Rails backend API, with MongoDb for persisting data. Inspired by the cyberpunk concept, I had a lot of fun with this project and wanted to end the program on a high note. I learned a ton about implementing a full React application and greatly expanded my CSS and UI design skills. ",
